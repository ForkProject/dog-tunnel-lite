# Dog Tunnel

## Introduction
This tunnel is a lite version if dog-tunnel, and actions without a middle server, has no ability of udp traversal, but simple and faster
### Example
the server side should have a public ip , such as xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, please replace it with your own ip
first, start a server
server: ./dtunnel_lite -v -service 127.0.0.1:1234 -dnscache 10

then start a client, you can seed the example below:
socks5 example:
client: ./dtunnel_lite -v -service xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:1234 -local :8787

Then you can connect to socks5 proxy with 127.0.0.1:8787

Here is some useful scripts:
```
# server side dtunnel_lite

#!/bin/sh
killall -9 dtunnel_lite
sleep 2
nice -n -20 /bin/dtunnel_lite -service 0.0.0.0:18080 -auth asecuritypassword &


# client side dtunnel_lite


#!/bin/sh
killall -9 dtunnel_lite
dtunnel_lite -service this.is.your.serverip:18080 -local :8070 -auth asecuritypassword &
```

ssh port forward example:
client: ./dtunnel_lite -v -service 127.0.0.1:1234 -local :8787 -action :22

It's better to add the -encrypt arg for privacy in client
you can add "-auth" on both sides for authorize

The default mode is udp mode, and is faster in the poor network than tcp mode, you can also use tcp mode with "-tcp" on both sides.
